## Inexpensive, opinionated website builder
Create a website hosting platform with the following features:
- easy to set up
- opionated and low-customizability
- fast to load
- easy to register a domain
- low annual fee ($50 or less for as many domains as you want)
- Easy to export content (probably Markdown files on the backend).

### Advantages over competing products
- Less exensive
- Easier to set up
- Easier to quit
### Disadvantages
- Less customizable

### Possible user experience
- _We whitelabel our own product_

We create several sites
- simplewedding.com
- myresume.com
- pitchdeck.com
- mysoccerclub.com
- mydaycare.com
- myrestarauntsite.com

Person lands on simpleresume.com

Pricing is transparent - $50 per year, and they see a demo of what the website will look like (1 site. No graphics options, though they can swap it out later.

User enters information.

User is asked questions through typeform-like interface.

Website is generated.
### Possible upsell
- Upsell user to purchase printed QR business cards
- Sell printed version of site (for weddings, etc).
- Presumably, since data came in structured, you can nicely-format the data.
- Pauline would use it if minimalistic templates & super simple interface to spin a new one up. Still interested in the idea of easily hide/show parts of the page without deleting anything
### Competitors
- Wix / SquareSpace / Forestry charge too much
- Wordpress is way to complex
- GitHub.com is intimidating (not hard, there's a difference).
- Notion is ugly
### Reasons to pursue
- We (Pauline, Arun, Owen) are each attracted to simple, pretty, and fast experiences.
- It's technically easy to implement.

### Reasons to avoid
- User acquisition. If you're whole business model is predicated on your product having fewer features and costing less, you can't pay to advertise.
- There's no moat. SquareSpace could easily release an ultra-cheap plan.

## 2020-02-07
We tried [Leia.ai](https://heyleia.com) and were really impressed. They claim to us ML and had a typeform approach, but the final product was a little janky.

[Adobe spark](https://spark.adobe.com) was really impressive and free, but you can't use your domain and the resulting pages domain have a proper URL structure.

### Decision to pass
Passed on this for the following reasons:
- There are awesome free options available online for building a website (though you don't get your domain. Examples include Adobe Spark)
- There are awesome free options available on line for building a website that do include a domain (GitHub Pages)
- There are awesome, _powerful_ options for building a site with GUI (SquareSpace, Wix)
- There are awesome self-hosted options (Hugo, Jekyll)
