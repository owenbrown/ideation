## Learning Management System
### Need
Companies need to train new and existing employees.
Thoughts:
- Definitely a potentially viable business.
- We know of at least two companies (OnQ and Julie's old company) for whom sales training is a pain point.
- Arun personally isn't attracted to it.

### New technology
We're interested in using Anki's two powerful features:
- active recall
- spaced repetition
to move vast amounts of corporate information into user's long term memory.

## Competition
Learning Managment Systems include:
- [Moodle](https://moodle.com/getstarted/)
  - Moodle is open-source, which mean you could self host on AWS for $50 a year (or on your existing server). Or pay them $120 a year and they'll host for you.
- [Docebo](https://www.docebo.com)
- [iSprint](https://www.ispringsolutions.com/ispring-suite)
