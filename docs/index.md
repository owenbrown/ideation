## Ideation
The purpose of this page is to track startup and / or attractive small business ideas.

## Training for sales people
- Definitely a potentially viable business.
- We know of at least two companies (OnQ and Julie's old company) for whom sales training is a pain point.
- Arun personally isn't attracted to it.

## Career services powered by ML
- Use GPT-3 to bulid a resume and LinkedIn profile
- Launch websites for users. 
- Possibly sold to college career services

## Inexpensive, opinionated website builder
Create a website hosting platform with the following features:
- easy to set up
- opionated and low-customizability
- fast to load
- easy to register a domain 
- low annual fee ($50 or less for as many domains as you want)
- Easy to export content (probably Markdown files on the backend).

### Advantages over competing products
- Less exensive
- Easier to set up
- Easier to quit
### Disadvantages
- Less customizable

### Possible user experience
- _We whitelabel our own product_

We create several sites
- simplewedding.com
- myresume.com
- pitchdeck.com
- mysoccerclub.com
- mydaycare.com
- myrestarauntsite.com

Person lands on simpleresume.com

Pricing is transparent - $50 per year, and they see a demo of what the website will look like (1 site. No graphics options, though they can swap it out later.

User enters information.

User is asked questions through typeform-like interface.

Website is generated.
### Possible upsell
- Upsell user to purchase printed QR business cards
- Sell printed version of site (for weddings, etc).
- Presumably, since data came in structured, you can nicely-format the data.
- Pauline would use it if minimalistic templates & super simple interface to spin a new one up. Still interested in the idea of easily hide/show parts of the page without deleting anything
### Competitors
- Wix / SquareSpace / Forestry charge too much
- Wordpress is way to complex
- GitHub.com is intimidating (not hard, there's a difference).
- Notion is ugly
### Reasons to pursue
- We (Pauline, Arun, Owen) are each attracted to simple, pretty, and fast experiences.
- It's technically easy to implement.

### Reasons to avoid
- User acquisition. If you're whole business model is predicated on your product having fewer features and costing less, you can't pay to advertise.
- There's no moat. SquareSpace could easily release an ultra-cheap plan.
### Browser extension
- Owen didn't understand this idea fully. It sounded like the concept was to serve ads over a browser extension, which is something that's been done for 30 year, and is a bad user experience. 
- The main idea I was that relevant ads would be a palatable user experience.
### Store website browsing data into a database
