# Ideation
The purpose of this page is to track startup and / or attractive small business ideas.

### Training for sales people
- Definitely a potentially viable business.
- We know of at least two companies (OnQ and Julie's old company) for whom sales training is a pain point.
- Arun personally isn't attracted to it.

### Career services powered by ML
- Use GPT-3 to bulid a resume and LinkedIn profile
- Launch websites for users.
- Possibly sold to college career services

### Browser extension
- Owen didn't understand this idea fully. It sounded like the concept was to serve ads over a browser extension, which is something that's been done for 30 year, and is a bad user experience. 
- The main idea I was that relevant ads would be a palatable user experience.
### Store website browsing data into a database
