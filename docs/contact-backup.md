# Contact backup
Most people store their contacts with Apple or Google. I personally use Google because I've been doing so for 12 years and I see no updside to switching.
## Problem
If my contacts were deleted from Google, they'd be gone for good. I have no backup.
Someone could take ower my account and delete them. Or it could happen accidentally.
## Low tech solution
Every 6 months, export all contacts and use Cyberduck to put them in a S3 bucket.
Why I'm at it, backup my photos.
## Competition
Marissia Mayer created [Sunshine Contacts](https://sunshine.com/).
If you have an iPhone, they presumably will make exporting your conacts frictionless.

## Where I'm at as of 2020-03-05 9:07 PM
Hmm...Sunshine Contacts seems like a great solution for most people.
ALso, tech savvy people can backup contacts in a sinlge step...

I'm not smelling any money here.
