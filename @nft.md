The economic sense of NFTs is a complex and debated topic.  While some NFTs have appreciated significantly in value, many others have not.  The value of an NFT is often driven by speculation and hype, rather than intrinsic value.  This makes them a risky investment. Whether they are a fad remains to be seen. While the initial hype may have subsided, the underlying technology of blockchain and its potential applications beyond digital art continue to be explored.  This suggests NFTs may evolve beyond their current form, but their long-term economic viability is still uncertain.
