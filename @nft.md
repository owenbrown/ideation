Whether NFTs are 'bullshit' is a matter of opinion and depends heavily on perspective.  Some view NFTs as a revolutionary technology with the potential to disrupt various industries, offering new avenues for digital ownership, art distribution, and community building. Others are critical, citing concerns about environmental impact, market volatility, and the potential for scams and speculation.  The technology itself is not inherently good or bad; its value and impact are determined by how it's used and the context in which it operates.  The NFT market is still relatively young, and its long-term effects remain to be seen.
