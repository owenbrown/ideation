# Thoughts on NFTS
What are non-fungible-tokens?

## Non-fungible tokens allow people to frictionlessly transfer control of scarce, useful assets.

#### Corollaries
- The amount of value delivered by NFTs is positively correlated with
- the value created by reducing the friction of transferring the asset
- the value of controlling the asset must provide some benefit.

#### Examples of assets whose control can be transferred,
- If I control a computer I can use it to render 3-d video, host content, etc.
- If I control software license, I can legally use that software.
- If I contrel copy-righted media, I can charge fees for the user of the media.

#### Implications
- Techonolgist interested in using NFTs should look for assets the are scarce assets that deliver value to the person controlling them.

#### Business Model - Tracking software licenses
Create a market for intellectual property licenses.
Tie each license to an NFT. The owner of the coin can prove ownership for any time period, and their is a frictionless method, a market even, for buying and selling the coins.

[Proof-of-concepts of this approach have been done.](https://medium.com/atchai/software-licences-as-non-fungible-tokens-1f0635913e41)

#### Tickets to sporting events / concerts
Control is important here! Only one person per ticket is admitted.
Scalpers often exchange tickets, trade them, etc., so a fraud-proof, frictionless solution would be valuable.
Pair it with a slick app for rendering the QR code that is scanned.
